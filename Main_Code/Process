1. Run around randomly while scanning with camera
    #Run both Object avoiding and Object Scan in a thread

    -- Object scanning
        -Loop
            #Identifies whether an object is within frame
            #Loop breaks once at least an object is found

2. Once an object is found, interrupt Object Scan and run Object tracking
    #interrupt Object scan, run object tracking with oject avoidance in a thread

    -- Object tracking
        -Loop
            #Locate the object on the camera frame
            #Center the object
            #Move forward


3. Once close to the object, use the arm to place into bin

4. Take the object to its designated location
